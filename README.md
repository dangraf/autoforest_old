# autoforest

This repository contains a jupyter notebook as a template that will do all the stuff from the [fastai machinelearning for coders] course automatically.
You just install the requirements and you will be albe to use the package "papermill" that will use the template notebook as a function. You call it using your own dataset and it will generate a model together with a report that can be used as a starting point for data exploration for tabular data.
